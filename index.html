          <h3>Tech</h3>
          <p>
            I began tinkering when I was 14 years old. I built a pc so I could
            play/use commands in Fallout 3. I began modifying various game
            consoles such as the Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and Xbox One. I even
            modified and jailbroken iOS devices beginning with redsn0w in 2009.
            I now have a homelab. My homelab consists of Proxmox,
            Docker/Portainer, Traefik, Pi-hole, Bitwarden, Crowdsec, Nextcloud,
            pfSense, Synology, Trilium, UptimeKuma, Plex, AudioBookShelf, and
            Calibre Web.

          <h3>Web Design and Development</h3>
          <p>
            I began making websites when my wife mentioned that I needed a
            portfolio for my photography. A week later I had made my first
            Wordpress website. A year later I had joined the Air Force and was
            at my first duty station. My Wife and I had decided to cofound
            Knight Digital Media. Since then I have made a dozen websites using
            various platforms using Wordpress, Duda, and KvCore. I took a course
            for iOS app development from the App Brewery and decided that I
            wanted to learn Full-Stack web development.
